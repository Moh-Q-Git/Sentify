# Sentiment Analyzer

This is a simple AI project that uses machine learning (Naive Bayes) to classify sentences as **positive** or **negative** in sentiment.

I also had some help from Chat-GPT to create some statements to classify them and to debug the code.

## Technologies:
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## How to run:
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```
   python sentiment_analyzer.py
   ```

3. Enter a sentence, and the model will predict the sentiment.

## Example:
```
Input: I feel amazing today!
Output: positive
```
